# svelte app tutorial

Book To Be Read List page. My first time playing around with svelte. Just a lil fun.

Built following Net Ninja Tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO), might be a little out of date at this point, but I got the jist.

## Get this project started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.
By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
